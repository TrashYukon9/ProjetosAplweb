        And my eyes get low in that all-white truck, I can barely see shit
        And my eyes get low in that all-white truck, I can barely see
        Girl, I might be
        And I overflow like mercury
        Glowing with uncertainty (glowing with uncertainty, oh)
        Circles at the Chevron (girl, I might be, oh)
        I might be forever gone (bitch, I might be gone)
        And my eyes get low in that all white truck, I can barely see shit
        Hit the gas like you wouldn't believe it
        Thank God, I was always healing
        In a time so slow, I was thinking 'bout us rearranging pieces
        Speeding up on that all-black Demon
        Going west, I don't got no reasons
        I was throwing stones at Hercules
        Throwing them so perfectly
        Circles at the Chevron
        I can't be forever young
        Empty choir, operated from above
        My voice will be their voice until I'm free
        My hands will be their hands until I'm free
